CMPT 115/117 Laboratory Outline and Instruction for TAs
         Department of Computer Science
         University of Saskatchewan
 ** Lab 1 
 ** Length: 80 min 
==========================================

Files on Moodle:
  — source.cc
  — printnumbers.cc

What to hand in:
  - a transcript (copy/paste) of the command-line work

Main points of emphasis:
  - get students working on the Macs
  - indicate that Linux has many similar applications (when the Mac lab is full)
  - students should begin to be comfortable with the command line 
	-- they don't have to be experts
  - students should be comfortable moving back and forth between Finder and Terminal
  - Eclipse is still available for use, but command line compilation is a necessary skill
  - don’t ignore compiler warnings, and emphasize debugging skills

During the lab:

  Part 1: Logging in and becoming familiar with the lab (10 min, unless something goes wrong)
	- make sure everyone can log in
	- go through Part 1 showing the icons for the programs.  
  Part 2: An Introduction to the Command-Line (5 min demo, 25 min work)
	- open Terminal, briefly demonstrate pwd, ls, mkdir, cd
	- let students work through Part 2 on their own
	- consult if they have problems
  Part 3: Compiling C++ Programs with the Command-Line (5 min demon, 25 min work)
	- open source.cc in TextWrangler
	- compile and run using command line
	- add cout , recompile, run;  
	- make one or two syntax errors; compile, show errors
	- let students work through Part 3
